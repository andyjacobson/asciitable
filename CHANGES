0.2.0
=====
Updates to the way lines are processed and comments handled for support of new formats.

- Splitter process_line and process_val and Inputter process_line are now object methods.
  This allows for settable parameters that control processing (e.g. continuation_char).

- Add BaseHeader and BaseData process_line methods that do comment and blank-line 
  filtering as needed.  Splitter process_line should no longer be used for this purpose.

- Add support for formats:
  - CommentedHeader (column def line begins with comment char)
  - DAOphot
  - Files with continuation lines via ContinuationLinesInputter class

- Add 'Inputter' as an option to get_reader() and read()
